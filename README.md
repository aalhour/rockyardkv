## Overview

<!-- RockyardKV is a Go-native, [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/)-compatible storage engine. -->
RockyardKV is a pure Go implementation of [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/).
It reads and writes RocksDB databases without CGo or C++ dependencies.

The project targets bit-compatible file formats with RocksDB. Files created by RockyardKV can be read by C++ RocksDB, and vice versa.

Built with a lot of respect for [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) - the foundational storage engine that inspired this work. No affiliation or endorsement implied.

> [!NOTE]
> **Project status:** Core storage operations work with verified format compatibility.
> Durability semantics are under active verification.
> Refer to [docs/status/](docs/status/README.md) for compatibility details and known limitations.

## Features

- **Storage:** LSM-tree with leveled, universal, and FIFO compaction; column families; snapshots; Bloom filters; Snappy, LZ4, Zstd, and Zlib compression
- **Write path:** Merge operators, range deletions, SST ingestion, write stall control
- **Transactions:** Optimistic and pessimistic modes with deadlock detection
- **Operations:** Backup engine, checkpoints, compaction filters, TTL, rate limiting
- **Deployment:** Read-only mode, secondary instances, Direct I/O

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/aalhour/rockyardkv
```

Requires Go 1.25 or later.

## Quick start

Open a database and perform basic operations:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/aalhour/rockyardkv/db"
)

func main() {
    opts := db.DefaultOptions()
    opts.CreateIfMissing = true

    database, err := db.Open("/tmp/mydb", opts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer database.Close()

    // Write a key-value pair
    err = database.Put(db.DefaultWriteOptions(), []byte("key"), []byte("value"))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Read the value back
    value, err := database.Get(db.DefaultReadOptions(), []byte("key"))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.Printf("value: %s", value)
}
```
